* TapType: Ten-finger text entry on everyday surfaces via Bayesian inference
  * Abstract
    * Despite the advent of touchscreens, typing on physical keyboards remains most efficient for entering text, because users can leverage all fingers across a full-size keyboard for convenient typing. As users increasingly type on the go, text input on mobile and wearable devices has had to compromise on full-size typing. In this paper, we present TapType, a mobile text entry system for full-size typing on passive surfaces—without an actual keyboard. From the inertial sensors inside a band on either wrist, TapType decodes and relates surface taps to a traditional QWERTY keyboard layout. The key novelty of our method is to predict the most likely character sequences by fusing the finger probabilities from our Bayesian neural network classifier with the characters’ prior probabilities from an n-gram language model. In our online evaluation, participants on average typed 19 words per minute with a character error rate of 0.6% after 30 minutes oftraining. Expert typists thereby consistently achieved more than 25WPM at a similar error rate. We demonstrate applications of TapType in mobile use around smartphones and tablets, as a complement to interaction in situated Mixed Reality outside visual control, and as an eyes-free mobile text input method using an audio feedback-only interface.

* TapID: Rapid Touch Interaction in Virtual Reality using Wearable Sensing
  * Abstract
    * Current Virtual Reality systems typically use cameras to capture user input from controllers or free-hand mid-air interaction. In this paper, we argue that this is a key impediment to productivity scenarios in VR, which require continued interaction over prolonged periods of time—a requirement that controller or free-hand input in mid-air does not satisfy. To address this challenge, we bring rapid touch interaction on surfaces to Virtual Reality—the input modality that users have grown used to on phones and tablets for continued use. We present TapID, a wrist-based inertial sensing system that complements headset-tracked hand poses to trigger input in VR. TapID embeds a pair of inertial sensors in a flexible strap, one at either side of the wrist; from the combination of registered signals, TapID reliably detects surface touch events and, more importantly, identifies the ﬁnger used for touch. We evaluated TapID in a series of user studies on event-detection accuracy (F1 = 0.997) and hand-agnostic ﬁnger-identiﬁcation accuracy (within-user: F1 = 0.93; across users: F1 =0.91 after 10 reﬁnement taps and F1 =0.87 without reﬁnement) in a seated table scenario. We conclude with a series of applications that complement hand tracking with touch input and that are uniquely enabled by TapID, including UI control, rapid keyboard typing and piano playing, as well as surface gestures.

* WrisText: One-handed Text Entry on Smartwatch using Wrist Gestures
  * Abstract
    * We present WrisText - a one-handed text entry technique for smartwatches using the joystick-like motion of the wrist. A user enters text by whirling the wrist of the watch hand, towards six directions which each represent a key in a circular keyboard, and where the letters are distributed in an alphabetical order. The design of WrisText was an iterative process, where we first conducted a study to investigate optimal key size, and found that keys needed to be 55º or wider to achieve over 90% striking accuracy. We then computed an optimal keyboard layout, considering a joint optimization problem of striking accuracy, striking comfort, word disambiguation. We evaluated the performance of WrisText through a five-day study with 10 participants in two text entry scenarios: hand-up and handdown. On average, participants achieved a text entry speed of 9.9 WPM across all sessions, and were able to type as fast as 15.2 WPM by the end of the last day.

* FingerPing: Recognizing Fine-grained Hand Poses using Active Acoustic On-body Sensing
  * Abstract
    * FingerPing is a novel sensing technique that can recognize various fine-grained hand poses by analyzing acoustic resonance features. A surface-transducer mounted on a thumb ring injects acoustic chirps (20Hz to 6,000Hz) to the body. Four receivers distributed on the wrist and thumb collect the chirps. Different hand poses of the hand create distinct paths for the acoustic chirps to travel, creating unique frequency responses at the four receivers. We demonstrate how FingerPing can differentiate up to 22 hand poses, including the thumb touching each of the 12 phalanges on the hand as well as 10 American sign language poses. A user study with 16 participants showed that our system can recognize these two sets of poses with an accuracy of 93.77% and 95.64%, respectively. We discuss the opportunities and remaining challenges for the widespread use of this input technique.

* Airwriting: Hands-free Mobile Text Input by Spotting and Continuous Recognition of 3d-Space Handwriting with Inertial Sensors
  * Abstract
    * We present an input method which enables complex hands-free interaction through 3d handwriting recognition. Users can write text in the air as if they were using an imaginary blackboard. Motion sensing is done wirelessly by accelerometers and gyroscopes which are attached to the back of the hand. We propose a two-stage approach for spotting and recognition of handwriting gestures. The spotting stage uses a Support Vector Machine to identify data segments which contain handwriting. The recognition stage uses Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to generate the text representation from the motion sensor data. Individual characters are modeled by HMMs and concatenated to word models. Our system can continuously recognize arbitrary sentences, based on a freely definable vocabulary with over 8000 words. A statistical language model is used to enhance recognition performance and restrict the search space. We report the results from a nine-user experiment on sentence recognition for person dependent and person independent setups on 3d-space handwriting data. For the person independent setup, a word error rate of 11% is achieved, for the person dependent setup 3% are achieved. We evaluate the spotting algorithm in a second experiment on a realistic dataset including everyday activities and achieve a sample based recall of 99% and a precision of 25%. We show that additional ﬁltering in the recognition stage can detect up to 99% of the false positive segments.
