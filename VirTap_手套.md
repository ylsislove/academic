* FingerT9: Leveraging Thumb-to-finger Interaction for Same-side-hand Text Entry on Smartwatches
  * Abstract
    * We introduce FingerT9, leveraging the action of thumb-tofinger touching on the finger segments, to support same-sidehand (SSH) text entry on smartwatches. This is achieved by mapping a T9 keyboard layout to the finger segments. Our solution avoids the problems of fat finger and screen occlusion, and enables text entry using the same-side hand which wears the watch. In the pilot study, we determined the layout mapping preferred by the users. We conducted an experiment to compare the text-entry performances of FingerT9, the tilt-based SSH input, and the direct-touch nonSSH input. The results showed that the participants performed significantly faster and more accurately with FingerT9 than the tilt-based method. There was no significant difference between FingerT9 and direct-touch methods in terms of efficiency and error rate. We then conducted the second experiment to study the learning curve on SSH text entry methods: FingerT9 and the tilt-based input. FingerT9 gave significantly better long-term improvement. In addition, eyes-free text entry (i.e., looking at the screen output but not the keyboard layout mapped on the finger segments) was made possible once the participants were familiar with the keyboard layout.

* DigiTouch: Reconfigurable Thumb-to-Finger Input and Text Entry on Head-mounted Displays
  * Abstract
    * Input is a significant problem for wearable systems, particularly for head mounted virtual and augmented reality displays. Existing input techniques either lack expressive power or may not be socially acceptable. As an alternative, thumb-to-finger touches present a promising input mechanism that is subtle yet capable of complex interactions. We present DigiTouch, a reconfigurable glove-based input device that enables thumb-to-finger touch interaction by sensing continuous touch position and pressure. Our novel sensing technique improves the reliability of continuous touch tracking and estimating pressure on resistive fabric interfaces. We demonstrate DigiTouch’s utility by enabling a set of easily reachable and reconfigurable widgets such as buttons and sliders. Since DigiTouch senses continuous touch position, widget layouts can be customized according to user preferences and application needs. As an example of a real-world application of this reconfigurable input device, we examine a split-QWERTY keyboard layout mapped to the user’s fingers. We evaluate DigiTouch for text entry using a multi-session study. With our continuous sensing method, users reliably learned to type and achieved a mean typing speed of 16.0 words per minute at the end of ten 20-minute sessions, an improvement over similar wearable touch systems.

* Vulture: A Mid-Air Word-Gesture Keyboard
  * Abstract
    * Word-gesture keyboards enable fast text entry by letting users draw the shape of a word on the input surface. Such keyboards have been used extensively for touch devices, but not in mid-air, even though their fluent gestural input seems well suited for this modality. We present Vulture, a word-gesture keyboard for mid-air operation. Vulture adapts touch based word-gesture algorithms to work in midair, projects users’ movement onto the display, and uses pinch as a word delimiter. A first 10-session study suggests text-entry rates of 20.6 Words Per Minute (WPM) and finds hand-movement speed to be the primary predictor of WPM. A second study shows that with training on a few phrases, participants do 28.1 WPM, 59% of the text-entry rate of direct touch input. Participants’ recall of trained gestures in mid-air was low, suggesting that visual feedback is important but also limits performance. Based on data from the studies, we discuss improvements to Vulture and some alternative designs for mid-air text entry.

* Argot: A Wearable One-Handed Keyboard Glove
  * Abstract
    * The Argot glove is a one-handed, wearable input device that allows a user to type all English letters, numbers, and symbols without use of a traditional keyboard. The device design considers variables and constraints such as dexterity, feedback, mobility, learnability, speed of input, errors and false inputs, permanence, and comfort, as well as previous user knowledge. The glove design was informed by experimental investigations aimed at balancing tradeoffs between physical variables (reach, dexterity, haptics) and cognitive variables (learnability, text-entry method). It uses weak magnetic interactions during “key” presses to provide passive haptic feedback and reduce the need for precision in proprioceptive hand positioning.

* Huffman Base-4 Text Entry Glove (H4-TEG)
  * Abstract
    * We designed and evaluated a Huffman base-4 Text Entry Glove (H4-TEG). H4-TEG uses pinches between the thumb and fingers on the user’s right hand. Characters and commands use base-4 Huffman codes for efficient input. In a longitudinal study, participants reached 14.0 wpm with error rates <1%. In an added session without visual feedback, entry speed dropped only by 0.4 wpm. Yet another session was added that required entry of text with punctuation and other symbols. Entry speed dropped by 1.5 wpm.

* A NewWearable Input Device: SCURRY
  * Abstract
    * A new wearable input device named SCURRY, developed by the Samsung Advanced Institute of Technology, is introduced in this paper. Based on inertial sensors, this device allows a human operator to select a specified character, an event, or an operation as the input he/she wants spatially through both hand motion and ﬁnger clicking. It is a glovelike device, which can be worn on the human hand, composed of a base module, including one controller and two angular-velocity sensors (gyroscopes) on the back of the hand, and four ring-type modules (rings), including two-axis acceleration sensors (accelerometers) on four ﬁngers. The base and the ring modules are integrated modules containing sensors, a transceiver or receiver for communication, and a microcontroller, which makes the device compact and light. The two gyroscopes embedded in the base module have a role in detecting the direction (up, down, right, and left) of the handmotion, and the accelerometers have a role in detecting ﬁnger motion generated by ﬁnger clicking. An algorithm for the exact ﬁnger-click recognition composed of three parts (feature extraction, valid-click discrimination, and crosstalk avoidance) is proposed to improve the recognition performance of ﬁnger clicking on SCURRY. The experimental results and discussions are presented. SCURRY can be used as a wearable mouse spatially, by allowing any three ﬁngers to be operated as the left, middle, and right mouse buttons, and in a similar manner, as a wearable keyboard, as it allows a human operator to point and select any character, event, or operation by his hand motion and ﬁnger clicking.
