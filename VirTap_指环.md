* QwertyRing: Text Entry on Physical Surfaces Using a Ring
  * Abstract
    * The software keyboard is widely used on digital devices such as smartphones, computers, and tablets. The software keyboard operates via touch, which is efficient, convenient, and familiar to users. However, some emerging technology devices such as AR/VR headsets and smart TVs do not support touch-based text entry. In this paper, we present QwertyRing, a technique that supports text entry on physical surfaces using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) ring. Users wear the ring on the middle phalanx of the index finger and type on any desk-like surface, as if there is a QWERTY keyboard on the surface. While typing, users do not focus on monitoring the hand motions. They receive text feedback on a separate screen, e.g., an AR/VR headset or a digital device display, such as a computer monitor. The basic idea ofQwertyRing is to detect touch events and predict users’ desired words by the orientation of the IMU ring. We evaluate the performance of QwertyRing through a five-day user study. Participants achieved a speed of 13.74 WPM in the first 40 minutes and reached 20.59 WPM at the end. The speed outperforms other ring-based techniques [24, 30, 45, 68] and is 86.48% of the speed of typing on a smartphone with an index finger. The results show that QwertyRing enables efficient touch-based text entry on physical surfaces.

* RotoSwype: Word-Gesture Typing using a RingD
  * Abstract
    * We propose RotoSwype, a technique for word-gesture typing using the orientation ofa ring worn on the index finger. RotoSwype enables one-handed text-input without encumbering the hand with a device, a desirable quality in many scenarios, including virtual or augmented reality. The method is evaluated using two arm positions: with the hand raised up with the palm parallel to the ground; and with the hand resting at the side with the palm facing the body. A five-day study finds both hand positions achieved speeds of at least 14 words-per-minute (WPM) with uncorrected error rates near 1%, outperforming previous comparable techniques.

* ThumbText: Text Entry for Wearable Devices Using a Miniature Ring
  * Abstract
    * Users can benefit from using an auxiliary peripheral that could mitigate many concerns with direct text entry on wearable devices. We introduce ThumbText, a thumb-operated text entry approach for a ring-sized touch surface. Through a multi-part exploration, we first identify a suitable discretization of the miniature touch surface for thumb input. We then design a number of two-step selection techniques for supporting the input of at least 28 characters. On a miniature touch surface, we find that a continuous touch-slide-lift selection technique in a 2×3 grid discretization offers improved performance gains over other selection methods. Finally, we evaluate ThumbText against techniques also designed for wearable devices and find that ThumbText allows for higher text entry rates than SwipeBoard and H4-Writer.

* FingerSound: Recognizing unistroke thumb gestures using a ring
  * Abstract
    * We introduce FingerSound, an input technology to recognize unistroke thumb gestures, which are easy to learn and can be performed through eyes-free interaction. The gestures are performed using a thumb-mounted ring comprising a contact microphone and a gyroscope sensor. A K-Nearest-Neighbor(KNN) model with a distance function ofDynamic Time Warping (DTW) is built to recognize up to 42 common unistroke gestures. A user study, where the real-time classification results were given, shows an accuracy of 92%-98% by a machine learning model built with only 3 training samples per gesture. Based on the user study results, we further discuss the opportunities, challenges and practical limitations of FingerSound when deploying it to real-world applications in the future.

* TypingRing: A Wearable Ring Platform for Text Input
  * Abstract
    * This paper presents TypingRing, a wearable ring platform that enables text input into computers of different forms, such as PCs, smartphones, tablets, or even wearables with tiny screens. The basic idea of TypingRing is to have a user wear a ring on his middle finger and let him type on a surface – such as a table, a wall, or his lap. The user types as if a standard QWERTY keyboard is lying underneath his hand but is invisible to him. By using the embedded sensors TypingRing determines what key is pressed by the user. Further, the platform provides visual feedback to the user and communicates with the computing device wirelessly. This paper describes the hardware and software prototype of TypingRing and provides an in-depth evaluation of the platform. Our evaluation shows that TypingRing is capable of detecting and sending key events in real-time with an average accuracy of 98.67%. In a ﬁeld study, we let seven users type a paragraph with the ring, and we ﬁnd that TypingRing yields a reasonable typing speed (e.g., 33 - 50 keys per minute) and their typing speed improves over time.

* An Energy Harvesting Wearable Ring Platform for Gesture Input on Surfaces
  * Abstract
    * This paper presents a remote gesture input solution for interacting indirectly with user interfaces on mobile and wearable devices. The proposed solution uses a wearable ring platform worn on a user’s index finger. The ring detects and interprets various gestures performed on any available surface, and wirelessly transmits the gestures to the remote device. The ring opportunistically harvests energy from an NFC-enabled phone for perpetual operation without explicit charging. We use a ﬁnger-tendon pressure-based solution to detect touch, and a light-weight audio based solution for detecting ﬁnger motion on a surface. The two-level energy efficient classiﬁcation algorithms identify 23 unique gestures that include tapping, swipes, scrolling, and strokes for hand written text entry. The classiﬁcation algorithms have an average accuracy of 73% with no explicit user training. Our implementation supports 10 hours of interactions on a surface at 2 Hz gesture frequency. The prototype was constructed with off-the-shelf components and has a form factor comparable to a large ring.
